# School_District_Analysis
Module 4

## Overview of school district analysis
In this challenge we were given data on a large set of school data and student data to find very specfic information to identify academic dishonesty. We have been asked to run an analysis on the students reading math scores for grades ninth thru 12th grades. The schoold board has asked that we replace all reading and math scores with NaN's until the true scores can be determined. Also, we have been asked to rerun the School District Analysis to determine how the NaN chnages effected the overall analysis.

## Results

Based off the results the impact to the district was not drastic as the NaN's did not have a negative imact to the calculations. Overall district and school spending decreases slightly
